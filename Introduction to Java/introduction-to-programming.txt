Types of Languages --> Procedural
			     Functional
			     Object-Oriented


Procedural :

- specifies a series of well-structural steps and procedures to compose a program
- contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a task


Functional :

- writing a program only in pure functions ie. never modify variables, but only create new ones as an output
- used in situations where we can perform lots of different operations on the same set of data, like ML
- first class functions?


Object Oriented :
- revolves around objects
- code + data = object
- developed to make it easier to develop, debug, reuse, and maintain software



Static vs Dynamic Languages -->

Static Languages :
- perform type checking at compile time
- errors wll show at compile time
- declare datatype before you use it
- more control


Dynamic Languages :
- perform type checking at runtiome
- error might not show till program is run
- no need to declare datatype of variables
- aves time in writing code but might give error at runtime
